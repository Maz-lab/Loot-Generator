/*
* This loot generator will create gear with randomized names, types and affixes.
* We will use txt files that contain the possible names types and affixes and 
* have the code read from them.
* We will accomplish the random part by using the random function from the math library.
* When an item is created we will prompt the user if they want to save it, if they do we will write the items
* characteristics to a new txt file meant to hold these results.
